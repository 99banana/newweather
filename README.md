# NewWeather
NewWeather is a small open-source project based on [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and the [US National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

**Hosted with [opeNode.io](https://www.openode.io)!** Thanks to opeNode for supporting open-source projects!

I am currently using the closed-source canvasJS graph library.
Something else open source with similar functionality would be appreciated if available.
