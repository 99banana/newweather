# NewWeather
NewWeather is a small open-source project based on [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and the [US National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

Designed to be a replacement for other bloated weather services that do not load or display well on mobile devces, NewWeather loads weather data from the NWS only the first time it is requested, and keeps that data for when it is needed again.

**NewWeather is now hosted with glitch: [newweather.glich.me](https://newweather.glitch.me/)**

### Graphs
NewWeather currently uses the closed-source canvasJS graph library.
Something else open source with similar functionality would be appreciated if available.

**Requirements**
- responsive
- open-source
- free
- similar functionality
