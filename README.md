## About

NewWeather is a small open source web app based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [US National Weather Service (NWS) API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). Being fed up with other bloated and slow-to-load weather services after the weather service we used previously merged with another one, and discouraged by the ugly and hard to read graphs on the NWS website, I decided to build my own small weather app. This app turns the NWS API data into non-bloated, readable graphs that wouldn't take too long to load, even on mobile devices with slower connections. Currently, the app is hosted on glitch but glitch apps fall asleep after only 5 minutes of inactivity.

I am currently using the closed-source canvasJS graph library.
Something else open source with similar functionality would be appreciated if available.
