# NewWeather
NewWeather is a small open-source project based on [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and the [US National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

**Hopefully soon to be hosted with [opeNode](https://openode.io).** Thanks to opeNode for supporting open-source projects!
NewWeather is hosted on glitch at [newweather.glich.me](https://newweather.glitch.me/)

I am currently using the closed-source canvasJS graph library.
Something else open source with similar functionality would be appreciated if available.
